#Welcome to my Tenzies game project. I built this game to test my fundamentals in React.

"Tenzies" is a simple and fast-paced dice game played with 10 dice. You have to get all the 10 dice to show the same face. You can keep rolling until you find the faces you chose.

In this app, I implemented the following:

-Rolling the dice by generating random values between 1-6 for each dice

-Holding a dice when clicked so that rolling for new values doesn't reset the ones we already clicked. The dice turn green when they're held using conditional rendering.

-You cant click on any dice unless you hit start game. There's a timer that tracks your round from start until you have won.

-Using localstorage and React side-effects, the player can save their best time achieved in winning their round.

-Used the value of the random number generated for each dice to display the exact number of dots as the value generated. The dice represent real life dice.

-Number of rolls are tracked for each round.

-When the round is won, the button displays an option to restart the game.

-And so on...

This application tested my capabilities to use React state and side-effects effectively.
